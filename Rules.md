# Jungle Blitz

Placing the mysterious totems in the expected configuration opened a secret path in the jungle. Without thinking, you and your peers decided to run before it closed behind you. Your eyes catch the reflection of shiny objects hidden in the jungle. As you move closer, you recognize diamonds, and start to hear voices whispering to you. The voices tell you that the only escape from this jungle labyrinth is to find and hold on to those diamonds scattered throughout the unfavorable landscape. You discover that whoever possesses these precious jewels absorb some mystical karma powers.

To generate these karma powers (points), your team will need to capture the precious gems. By holding these gems, the diamonds will accumulate karma, but that is not enough. Your team units will have to drop the diamonds to the ground to officially gain the karma they have generated by releasing the energy accumulated within the stones.

However, you soon realize that you’re not alone. You find that others are trying to do the same. You’ll need to defend and strategize in order to keep these foes away from your diamonds. To do so, you may throw vines to keep the other units from reaching the stones, or to help teammates escape if threatened by others.

In the end, the team with the most karma (points) will have the power to escape the jungle and return home with the valuable gems!

# Game components and mechanics


## Diamonds <img src="/images/DXL.png" width="50"/>

The most precious game pieces. Hold diamonds to accumulate karma points. Accelerate the accumulation of points by summoning them. Drop them on the ground to gain pending points. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. Pending points are lost if diamonds are not dropped before the end of the game.

### Diamond summon levels

Each level must be completed before attempting a new level of summon, you have to go 2-3-4-5, you cannot summon for 5 turns to go from 1 to 5 directly.

| Level      | When summoning, you’re unable to move for | Point(s) per turn holding the diamond |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 (default) <img src="/images/DL.png" width="25">      | -       | 1       |
| 2 <img src="/images/D2L.png" width="25">      | 2 turns       | 2       |
| 3 <img src="/images/D3L.png" width="25">      | 3 turns       | 3       |
| 4 <img src="/images/D4L.png" width="25">      | 4 turns       | 4       |
| 5 <img src="/images/D5L.png" width="25">      | 5 turns       | 5       |

### Diamond visuals

The diamond will change shape and color depending on which summon level it’s at and depending on how many points are pending on the diamond. The following chart, available in the UI with the D keyboard shortcut, gives you the mappings : <img src="/images/diamonds_visuals.png">

### Tile types

| Image      | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| <img src="/images/vegetation.png" width="75">      | SPAWN       | Unit spawn location. Units will spawn here at the start of the game and after a unit has been killed.       |
| <img src="/images/wall1.png" width="75"><br><img src="/images/wall2.png" width="75"><br><img src="/images/wall3.png" width="75">      | WALL       | It’s a non-walkable tile, move around it if possible       |
| <img src="/images/empty.png" width="75">      | EMPTY       | Tile available for movement. However, “empty” doesn’t mean that it’s free of enemy/friendly units or diamonds.       |

### Units

Each team has a number of units that will vary depending on the map, the number of enemy teams, and the tournament progress.

## Unit actions

Each turn, depending on their location/possession, units can take one of the following actions:

### Spawning

<img src="/images/spawn.gif">

At the start of the game, you must spawn each of your units on a spawn tile. In addition, when a unit is killed, you must spawn it on a spawn tile to put it back into play. There are many spawn tiles on each map, so choosing the right one is of utmost importance!

Spawn tiles, like any other tiles, can only have 1 player at a time. If you select a spawn tile that is already occupied, the game will try to place you on an adjacent walkable spawn tile.

### Moving

<img src="/images/move.gif">

Units can move toward any destination without having to compute a full path. They follow a path without obstacles on the map towards the desired destination. Be aware that paths are known by all teams, so they will be able to figure out your targeted tile. If a path is blocked by a wall or another unit, the unit will try to find an alternate route. You must send a MOVE action towards the desired tile on every turn to continue moving towards it.

When in a spawn zone, your unit can either stay put (using the NONE action) or move to another spawn tile, as long as it doesn’t leave the zone. Once out, these spawn tiles are considered to be walls, so plan your exit accordingly as you will no longer be able to move on these tiles!

Note: There can only be one (1) unit per tile. When two (2) units want to reach the same tile during a turn, the unit that comes after the other in the turn execution order (specified in the payload) will be denied.

### Collecting a diamond

<img src="/images/collect_diamond.gif">

To pick up a diamond, you need to move onto the tile with a diamond. The unit will automatically pick up the diamond for you on the same turn. If multiple diamonds are on the tile, the user will pick the one with the most pending points.

### Holding a diamond

<img src="/images/hold.gif">

Holding one diamond will raise the pending points of the diamond. It will accumulate a number of points depending on the summon level of the diamond.

When holding a diamond, the only options are the MOVE, SUMMON, DROP, or the NONE action.

### Dropping a diamond

<img src="/images/drop.gif">

Dropping a diamond with the DROP action will immediately attribute the karma points to the unit who dropped it, except if the diamond is dropped on another unit. In that case, the diamond keeps its pending points and summon levels, and the other unit now holds it.

### Summoning a diamond’s higher spirit

<img src="/images/summon.gif">

Diamonds' spirits can be summoned to increase the karma they provide when holding them. Diamonds with a higher summon level give more pending points to the units in possession of them each turn.

Important : You cannot cancel a summon action, meaning that your unit will be vulnerable to attacks for the number of turns it takes to upgrade the diamond to the next summon level. Make sure that your unit is in a safe spot before taking this action!

For example, if you want to bring a diamond you are holding from level 2 to level 3, you will be locked in place for 3 turns doing the SUMMON action.

To summon a diamond, simply send a SUMMON action when holding a diamond. This will start the summoning process until it’s done, with no other required action from your part. During that locked-in period, the only actions accepted will be SUMMON and NONE or you can omit completely an action for that specific unit.

When the summoning process is done, the diamond will accumulate more points, and the unit will be able to move again or summon the diamond to the next level.

### Attacking

<img src="/images/attack.gif">

Attacking a unit can only be done on an adjacent tile (i.e., up, down, left, and right - no diagonals).

Attacking a unit with a diamond transfers the diamond to the attacking unit in its current state (i.e., the number of pending points and summon level).

An attacked unit will disappear from the map. The dead unit can be respawned on the next turn as per the spawn rules.

### Vines

<img src="/images/vine.gif"> 

In order to stop an opponent or help a teammate, you have the possibility to use a vine to bring another unit close to you.

To do this, the following conditions must be filled:

*   The target unit:

    *  must be alive
    *   must not be on a spawn tile
    *   must be on the same line of tiles (vertical or horizontal) as the unit who’s doing the VINE action

*   The unit who’s doing the VINE action must not possess a diamond
*   The path between the two units must be clear of walls and spawn tiles (there can be enemy or friendly units or diamonds)

Once the requirements are met, you specify the position of the unit you want to entwine, and this unit will be relocated to the closest empty tile next to you in the shooting line.

When the entwined unit is holding a diamond, depending on its allegiance:

*   If the unit is an enemy, they will drop the diamond where they were standing. The diamond will preserve its current state (i.e., the number of pending points and summon level) while on the ground. Therefore, other teams can pick it up and score points from it, so try to get it back before they do!

*   If the unit is a teammate, they will be brought right next to the unit who performed the VINE action with the diamond still in their possession.

# Unfolding of the game

## Turn

For each turn, your team must respond with one action listed for each of your units.

If you take more than 150 ms to answer, your turn is skipped.

To help runtimes that use JIT compilation, the first 10 turns are given an extra 1000 ms to answer.

A game consists of 300 turns.

## Turn order

The team playing order is deterministic and known by all players. It is randomized every n² turns, n being the number of teams. This can have an impact depending on the unit actions. For example, for two units attacking each other during the same turn, only the attack from the team playing before the other will go through. Or, if you try to vine someone, if the targeted unit moves before your vine action, the action will fail.
