# Blitz 2022

Welcome to Blitz 2022! This repository contains all the source code for the game backend and the game visualization that was used in the [Coveo Blitz](https://2022.blitz.codes/) competition.

## Run instructions

Head over to the [game folder](/game) to run the game backend. For simplicity, we have packaged a working version of the game visualization directly in the backend that you can access [here](http://localhost:8765) when the backend is running.

If you're feeling adventurous, the game visualization source code and build instructions are available in the [miniui folder](/miniui).

## Game rules
