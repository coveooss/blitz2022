# Blitz 2022 UI

This is the source code for the game visualization. For simplicity, a built version of this is commited in the game folder and can be accessed [when running the backend](http://localhost:8765/) directly. But if you want to make modifications to it, you can do so and run it with the build instructions.

## Build instructions

Install with `npm install` and run `npm run dev -- --open`. It should open `localhost:3000` with the visualization.

Now run the backend and everything should work!
